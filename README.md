# 1D_Fin_insulatedTip
Conatins the solution for the problem 1 Dimension heat conduction in a fin with insulated tip.
Drichlet boundary condition at one side i.e. Temp given at base.
The problem is solved non dimensionally i.e Temp varies b/w 0 and 1(at the base).
1D grid generated with equally spaced nodes/elements based on the no of points input by the user.
Various methods can be used for iteration like Gauss Elimination, Gauss Seidel, SOR,etc.

# 2D_Steady_HC
Solving 2D heat conduction equation subjected to Drichlet boundary conditions.
Both analytical method and Gauss Seidel iteration scheme used.
